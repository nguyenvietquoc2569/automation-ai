üîß SESSION ORGANIZATION FIX - DETAILED ANALYSIS
===============================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
After login and page refresh, users were redirected to /dashboard/error/none-org 
because the session appeared to have no available organizations.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. The session.availableOrgIds was being populated correctly from UserRole
2. BUT the buildSessionResponse() method was filtering out inactive organizations
3. This caused availableOrgs to be empty if all user's orgs were inactive
4. The OrganizationGuard checks availableOrgs.length and redirects if 0

SPECIFIC CODE ISSUES:

‚ùå BEFORE (Problematic):
\`\`\`typescript
// In buildSessionResponse method:
const orgs = await Organization.find({
  _id: { $in: freshAvailableOrgIds },
  active: true  // <-- This filtered out inactive orgs!
}).select('name displayName logo active');

// For current org:
if (org && org.active) {  // <-- Only returned active orgs
  currentOrg = { ... };
}
\`\`\`

‚úÖ AFTER (Fixed):
\`\`\`typescript
// In buildSessionResponse method:
const orgs = await Organization.find({
  _id: { $in: freshAvailableOrgIds }
  // Removed active:true filter - include all orgs
}).select('name displayName logo active');

// For current org:
if (org) {  // <-- Return org regardless of active status
  currentOrg = {
    ...
    isActive: org.active  // <-- Let frontend handle active/inactive
  };
}
\`\`\`

BEHAVIOR CHANGES:
- availableOrgs now includes both active AND inactive organizations
- currentOrg is returned even if the organization is inactive
- The frontend OrganizationGuard can now properly handle organization states
- Users won't be wrongly redirected to the error page

WHY THIS FIXES THE ISSUE:
1. Session responses now accurately reflect user's actual organization memberships
2. The OrganizationGuard can distinguish between "no orgs" vs "inactive orgs"
3. Users with inactive orgs can see them and potentially request reactivation
4. Eliminates false "no organization" errors

TESTING SCENARIOS:
‚úÖ User with active organizations - works normally
‚úÖ User with inactive organizations - sees orgs but with inactive status
‚úÖ User with mixed active/inactive orgs - sees all, can use active ones
‚úÖ User with no organizations - properly shows "no org" error
‚úÖ Page refresh maintains proper organization state
`);

console.log('‚úÖ Session organization issue has been resolved!');
