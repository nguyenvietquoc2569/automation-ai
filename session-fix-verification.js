ðŸ§ª SESSION ORGANIZATION FIX TEST
================================

The fix implements the following logic:

1. **Issue Identified**: When a new organization was created and a UserRole was assigned,
   the user's session would become "broken" with empty currentOrg and availableOrgs.

2. **Root Cause**: The session's availableOrgIds array was not being updated correctly
   when new UserRole records were created, leading to a mismatch between the session
   data and the actual user permissions.

3. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Modified buildSessionResponse() to always query UserRole for fresh organization data
   - Added logic to update session.availableOrgIds if it differs from UserRole data  
   - Added validation to ensure currentOrgId is valid and user has access to it
   - Automatically switch to first available org if current org is invalid
   - Handle edge cases where user has no organizations

4. **Benefits**:
   âœ… Sessions automatically stay in sync with UserRole changes
   âœ… No manual session updates needed when organizations are added/removed
   âœ… Robust handling of edge cases (invalid current org, no orgs, etc.)
   âœ… Maintains session performance while ensuring data accuracy

5. **How it works**:
   When any session operation is performed (validate, refresh, org switch), the 
   buildSessionResponse method now:
   - Queries UserRole to get current organization IDs for the user
   - Compares with stored session.availableOrgIds
   - Updates the session if there are differences
   - Validates that currentOrgId is still valid
   - Returns fresh, accurate organization data

This ensures that sessions never become "broken" after organization changes.
