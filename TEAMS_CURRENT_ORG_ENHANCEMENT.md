# Teams Management - Current Organization Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the teams management page at `/dashboard/teams` to highlight the current organization and disable actions for it, with informative tooltips explaining the policy.

## Changes Made

### 🎨 **Visual Enhancements**
- **Current Organization Highlighting**: Current org rows have a golden background (`#fef3c7`) with orange border (`#f59e0b`)
- **Current Badge**: Added a blue "Current" badge next to the current organization name
- **Visual Distinction**: Current org is clearly distinguishable from other organizations

### 🔒 **Policy Enforcement**
- **Disabled Actions**: Edit button and active/inactive switch are disabled for the current organization
- **Requirement**: Users must switch to another organization before making changes to the current one
- **Security**: Prevents accidental self-modification of current context

### 💡 **User Experience**
- **Tooltips**: Added informative tooltips explaining why actions are disabled
  - For current org: "Switch to another organization to edit/modify the current one"
  - For permission issues: "You don't have permission to edit/change this organization"
- **Interactive Feedback**: Tooltips appear on hover over disabled actions

## Technical Implementation

### 🏗️ **Component Structure**
```tsx
interface OrganizationTableProps {
  organizations: OrganizationListItem[];
  currentOrgId?: string;  // NEW: Pass current org ID
  onEdit: (org: OrganizationListItem) => void;
  onToggleStatus: (org: OrganizationListItem, newStatus: boolean) => void;
}
```

### 🎯 **Logic Updates**
```tsx
const isCurrentOrg = org.id === currentOrgId;
const canEdit = permissions.canEdit && !isCurrentOrg;
const canToggleStatus = permissions.canToggleStatus && !isCurrentOrg;
```

### 🎨 **Styling**
- **Highlight Styles**: Golden background and border for current org
- **Badge Styles**: Blue current organization badge
- **Tooltip Styles**: Dark tooltips with arrows
- **Disabled States**: Visual feedback for disabled actions

### 🔧 **Session Integration**

- Leverages existing session management infrastructure
- No additional API calls required
