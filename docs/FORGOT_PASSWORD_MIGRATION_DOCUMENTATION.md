# Forgot Password Page Migration to Nx Library

## Overview

The forgot password page has been successfully migrated from the main workforce app to a dedicated Nx library `@automation-ai/forget-page`. This follows the same pattern as the login and register page migrations and Nx best practices for code organization and reusability.

## Migration Details

### What was moved:
- **From**: `/apps/workforce/src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx` (integrated component)
- **To**: `/libs/feature/user-auth/forget-page/src/lib/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` (reusable library component)

### Architecture Changes:

1. **Library Structure**:
   ```
   libs/feature/user-auth/forget-page/
   ├── package.json           # Package configuration with dependencies
   ├── project.json           # Nx project configuration
   ├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript project references
   ├── tsconfig.lib.json      # Library-specific TypeScript config
   └── src/
       ├── index.ts           # Library exports
       └── lib/
           ├── forget-page.ts         # Original function (kept for backward compatibility)
           └── ForgotPasswordPage.tsx # New React component
   ```

2. **Dependency Injection Pattern**:
   The library component now accepts external dependencies as props:
   - `LanguageSwitcher`: Language switcher component
   - `LinkComponent`: Navigation component (Next.js Link)
   - `onForgotPassword`: Custom forgot password handler function

3. **Workspace Configuration**:
   - Updated `tsconfig.base.json` with path mappings
   - Configured TypeScript project references
   - Added library build targets in Nx

## Usage

### In the Workforce App:
```tsx
import { ForgotPasswordPage } from '@automation-ai/forget-page';
import { LanguageSwitcher } from '../components/LanguageSwitcher';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function ForgotPasswordPageWrapper() {
  const handleForgotPassword = async (values) => {
    // Custom forgot password logic
  };

  return (
    <ForgotPasswordPage 
      LanguageSwitcher={LanguageSwitcher}
      LinkComponent={Link}
      onForgotPassword={handleForgotPassword}
    />
  );
}
```

### In Other Apps:
```tsx
import { ForgotPasswordPage } from '@automation-ai/forget-page';

// Use with custom components
<ForgotPasswordPage 
  LanguageSwitcher={MyLanguageSwitcher}
  LinkComponent={MyRouter}
  onForgotPassword={myAuthService.forgotPassword}
/>

// Use with defaults (basic HTML links)
<ForgotPasswordPage onForgotPassword={myAuthService.forgotPassword} />
```

## Benefits

1. **Reusability**: Forgot password page can be used across multiple applications
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication UI separated from app-specific logic
3. **Testability**: Library can be tested independently
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for forgot password functionality
5. **Framework Agnostic**: Library doesn't directly depend on Next.js

## Dependencies

The library includes these dependencies:
- `react` & `react-dom`: Core React dependencies
- `antd`: UI components
- `react-intl`: Internationalization
- Framework-specific dependencies injected via props

## TypeScript Configuration

The migration uses TypeScript project references for proper dependency management:
- Library compiles independently
- Type-safe imports in consuming applications
- Supports incremental compilation

## Forgot Password Features

The migrated component includes:
- **Email Input Form**: Single email field with validation
- **Success State**: Automatic transition to success screen after submission
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Back to Login**: Navigation link to return to login page
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages via react-intl
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Custom Styling**: Gradient background and modern card design

## State Management

The component manages two main states:
1. **Form State**: Email input form with validation
2. **Success State**: Confirmation screen showing email was sent

## Build Verification

✅ Library builds successfully: `npx nx build forget-page`
✅ Workforce app builds successfully with library integration
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ No import or dependency errors

## Migration Summary

This completes the forgot password page migration, establishing consistency with the login and register page patterns. All three authentication pages now follow the same architecture:

- **Login Page** → `@automation-ai/login-page`
- **Register Page** → `@automation-ai/user-register-page`  
- **Forgot Password Page** → `@automation-ai/forget-page`

## Next Steps

With all three authentication pages migrated, the next logical steps could include:
- Dashboard components → `@automation-ai/dashboard-components`
- Common form components → `@automation-ai/form-components`
- Other shared UI components

The forgot password page migration completes the authentication library suite and establishes a robust foundation for reusable UI libraries in the Nx workspace.
